## Party details
Akhil Bharatiya Jan Sangh (अखिल भारतीय जनसंघ, All India Popular Union) is a Hindu nationalist political party in India. The party claims to be the authentic Bharatiya Jan Sangh, which is the precursor of the Bharatiya Janata Party. ABJS was founded by Balraj Madhok, a former general secretary of BJS who had been expelled from that party in 1973, after he left the Janata Party in 1979. Madhok remains a leading figure in ABJS.

The general secretary of ABJS is Prafull Goradia, a former BJP Rajya Sabha MP.
