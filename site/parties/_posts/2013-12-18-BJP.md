---## Party details
The Bharatiya Janata Party ( pronunciation (help·info);; Hindi: भारतीय जनता पार्टी ; translation: Indian People's Party; abbreviated BJP, भाजपा ) is one of the two major parties in the Indian political system, the other being the Indian National Congress. Established in 1980, it is India's second largest political party in terms of representation in parliament and in the various state assemblies.

The Bharatiya Janata Party designates its official ideology and central philosophy to be "integral humanism", based upon a 1965 book by Deendayal Upadhyaya. The party is labelled as "Hindu nationalist", and advocates social conservatism, self-reliance as outlined by the Swadeshi movement, and a foreign policy centred on key nationalist principles. The party's platform is generally considered to be on the right-wing of the Indian political spectrum.
