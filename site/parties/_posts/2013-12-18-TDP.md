## Party details
Telugu Desam Party (Telugu: తెలుగు దేశం పార్టీ) (lit. Party for Telugu Land and People), abbreviated as TDP, is a regional political party in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The party was founded by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao ("NTR") on 29 March 1982. Since 1995, the party is headed by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the incumbent Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.

The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh. It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989. The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.
