## National Newspapers
[Indian Express Elections][1] have pages on politicians, parties, polls, quotes, videos and social media. [Times of India][2] presents dance of elections has schedule, social sentiment analysis. [The Hindu][3] has constituency watch and splits the coverage by geographic regions (north, south, east, west and central).

## International Media
[The Guardian][4] covers the Indian elections with great rigo. My favorite is [the interactive guide](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/07/-sp-indian-election-2014-interactive-guide-narendra-modi-rahul-gandhi) to Indian elections, in addition to being very informative it has great infographics.

[The New York Times][5] and [Al Jazeera][6] have also interesting continued coverage of these elections. Especially Al Jazeera has a great articles on election [manifestos](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/manifestos-indian-elections-201441434237199300.html) by various national parties.

## Local Media
Some local newspapers like [Maharashtra Times][7] are just translating national news in a local language. Some local only publications like [LokMat][8] cover celebrities and local twists to the national elections.

## Internet/ Social Media
[Google][9] has setup election center, which helps voters lookup candidates, and Twitter has become lifeblood of polls and controversies :).
