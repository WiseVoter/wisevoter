This week I spent some time analysing the data from Lok Sabha elections 2009. It
was an ardous task to get to this [result](http://www.wisevoter.org/parties.html).
From the data one can spot few insights like:
* We have quite a few SC/ST parliament assemblies
* INC (Indian National Congress) is very strong in North east

What are your conclusions and insights? Please comment.
