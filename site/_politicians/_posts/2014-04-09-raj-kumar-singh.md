##Summary
Raj Kumar Singh is an Indian politician. R.K.Singh is a 1975 batch Bihar cadre Indian Administrative Service officer. On 30 October 1990, R.K. Singh, then district magistrate of Samastipur, first shot to fame by arresting BJP patriarch L.K. Advani during his rath yatra in Bihar, while his rath yatra was en route to Ayodhya in UP from Somnath in Gujarat. RK Singh did the arrest on government orders from Lalu Prasad Yadav Government. On 13 December 2013,R.K Singh joined Bharatiya Janata Party. There are speculations that R.K.Singh is likely to contest from either Arrah or Supaul Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar in 2014 Lok Sabha polls, though Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has objected to R.K.Singh contesting from Supaul.
