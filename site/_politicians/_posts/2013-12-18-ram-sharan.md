##Summary
Ram Sharan is a politician of Indian descent. From 2001 to 2006, he represented the Macuata East Cakaudrove Indian Communal Constituency, one of 19 reserved for Indo-Fijians, which he held for the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) in the parliamentary elections of 2001 with more than 75 percent of the vote.
