##Summary
Imran Masood is an Indian politician belonging to Indian National Congress. He is a former member of Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elected from Muzaffarabad in Saharanpur district in 2007. Imran Masood is nephew of Rashid Masood a former minister who has the dubious record of being first politician losing his position on being arrested on corruption charges and is contesting 2014 election from Saharanpur (Lok Sabha constituency). Imran was earlier in Samajwadi Party.

In March 2014, a video clip surfaced in which Masood was seen threatening the BJP's Prime-ministerial Candidate, Narendra Modi. Masood's partisans claim that this clip was six months old and had been deliberately leaked to polarize the electorate ahead of the Lok Sabha election.
