##Summary


Mohammad Azharuddin  pronunciation (help·info) (born 8 February 1963) is an Indian politician and former cricketer. He was an accomplished batsman and captained the Indian cricket team for much of the 1990s, until being banned for his involvement in a match-fixing scandal. The lifetime ban for his alleged match fixing was later found illegal by Andhra Pradesh High Court. A member of the Indian National Congress, Azharuddin won from the Moradabad constituency of Uttar Pradesh to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India.
