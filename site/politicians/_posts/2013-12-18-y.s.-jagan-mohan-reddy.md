##Summary
Yeduguri Sandinti Jaganmohan Reddy (Telugu: యెదుగూరి సందింటి జగన్మోహన్ రెడ్డి) (born December 21, 1972), also called Jagan is an Indian politician and is a member of the Parliament of India from Kadapa constituency. He is the son of the former Chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy.

From May 2012 till Sept 2013, he was in jail under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 for amassing wealth at at an enormous scale by providing quid pro quo favours to businesses. A series of bail applications were repeatedly rejected by three levels of courts partly owing to "the serious nature of the offence", with estimated "amounts exceeding Rs. 3000 crores." The YSR Congress and other opposition parties have alleged that Jagan is being politically victimized and the CBI is acting at the behest of the Congress and that this is a case of political vendetta. After 16 months, on September 23, 2013, a special CBI court granted him bail, but he is not permitted to leave Andhra Pradesh.
