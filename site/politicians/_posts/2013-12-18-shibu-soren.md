##Summary
Shibu Soren (born 11 January 1944,in Nemra village of Ramgarh district ) is an Indian politician and a former Chief Minister of Jharkhand state in India who has been previously convicted in a criminal case by the Delhi High Court. Mr. Soren was the first serving Union minister to be convicted for murder. He allegedly did so to cover up a case of corruption and sodomy. He was sworn in as the 3rd Chief Minister of Jharkhand on December 30, 2009 after winning the Jharkhand Assembly elections. He resigned on May 30, 2010 after failing to obtain coalition support from the Bharatiya Janata Party, his national party partner. He previously represented the Dumka constituency of Jharkhand in the 14th Lok Sabha, and is the President of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) political party, a constituent of the UPA.

On January 9, 2009, Soren was defeated in the by-election to the Tamar assembly constituency to political novice Gopal Krishan Patar alias Raja Peter of the Jharkhand Party by a margin of over 9,000 votes. After the Assembly elections Soren once again formed the Government along with the BJP, and was sworn in as chief minister of Jharkhand on 30 December 2009.
