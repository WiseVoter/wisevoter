##Summary
Subhash Sureshchandra Deshmukh (born 12 March 1957) is the member of the 14th Lok Sabha of India. He represents the solapur constituency of Maharashtra and is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

He is the founder and chairman of Lokmangal Group. Traditionally Solapur is the congress fort, in spite of that Subhash Deshmukh is emerging as a good leader. He is more of a social worker than a politician, and this is how he himself would like to be known in his constituency. With the cooperation of his activist friends, he has initiated a plethora of social service projects under the banner of Lokmangal, which over the years have grown like a large banyan tree in and around Solapur. The many institutions that he has set up have become the backbone of Solapurâ€™s social, educational and industrial infrastructure.
