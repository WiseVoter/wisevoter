##Summary
Kalyan Singh (born 5 January 1932) is an Indian politician from the state of Uttar Pradesh. He has served three times as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Kalyan Singh is known as a Hindutva hardliner and his role in Babri Masjid demolition was controversial. The Liberhan Commission criticized CM Kalyan Singh and his government for pre-planned mannered events, misuse of power, attracting youth for support, and allowing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to run the state government directly. The commission states that the state government had "systematically and in a pre-planned manner removed inconvenient bureaucrats from positions of power, dismantled and diluted the security apparatus and infrastructure, lied consistently to the high court and the Supreme Court of India and to the people of India to evade constitutional governance and thus betrayed the confidence of the electorate". Addressing reporters in Etah, Kalyan Singh once said that he owns full responsibility for the demolition of the 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992, thus reigniting the controversial Ramjanmabhoomi dispute.
