##Summary
Naveen Jindal (born 9 March 1970) is an Indian politician and Member of Parliament (MP) from the Kurukshetra Lok Sabha constituency in the northern Indian state of Haryana. He is the Chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Limited, which is part of the $17 billion diversified O.P. Jindal Group founded by his late industrialist father.

He instigated an initiative that led to a revision of the Flag Code of India which now grants every Indian citizen the right to fly the Flag of India (also known as the "Tiranga") publicly with dignity and honour on all days of the year. He is an active campaigner for population stabilisation, womenâ€™s empowerment, environmental conservation, health and education. As an acknowledgement of his support to his alma mater, in 2011 the University of Texas at Dallas, renamed its School of Management as the Naveen Jindal School of Management.
