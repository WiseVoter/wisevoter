<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to WiseVoter Pages.</h3>

<p>This site was created in the 2009 India general elections. This <a href="http://bit.ly/wv-intro" target="_blank">article </a> outlines the purpose and motivation, while <a href="http://bit.ly/wv-press" target="_blank">this</a> one outlines similar dated efforts. With 2014 Indian general elections around the corner, I'm revamping this effort as an opensource initiative which can perhaps we aligned with other like minded people. Over time we hope to update the data with ofcourse your help, and grow this effort tackling some of the voter education issues like below:</p>

<ul>
  <li> View Politician (e.g <a href=/politicians/RahulGandhi>Rahul Gandhi</a>) Bio's and understand their education and criminal record.</li>
  <li> Browse constituencies (<a href=/constituencies>Consituencies</a> Page)</li>
  <li> Learn about political parties and their agenda (<a href=/parties>Parties</a> Page)</li>
  <li> Visualize data on politicians (<a href="http://bit.ly/wv-data" target="_blank">Google Fusion Tables</a> - compare politicians, parties etc.)</li>
  <li> Learn relevant electoral issues (Issues <a href=/issues>list</a>)</li>
  <li> Contribute to refine politician bios </li>
  <li> Towards election date: register to vote, report voting fraud etc at <a href="http://bit.ly/wv-jaagore" target="_blank">Jaagore</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>
